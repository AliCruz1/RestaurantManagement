# Email System Deployment Guide

## ✅ What I've Set Up For You

### 1. Fixed VS Code Settings
- Removed problematic Deno extension reference
- Set proper TypeScript formatter

### 2. Created Email Processing API
- **Route**: `/api/process-email-queue`
- **Security**: Protected with API key
- **Function**: Processes pending emails from database queue

### 3. Updated Environment Variables
- Added `EMAIL_PROCESSOR_API_KEY` for security
- Ready for Supabase service role key

## 🚀 Next Steps (Safe & Easy)

### Step 1: Set Up Database Schema
Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard (SQL Editor):

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of supabase-email-queue.sql
-- This creates the email_queue table and functions
```

### Step 2: Test Email Queue System
1. Make a reservation on your app
2. Check the `email_queue` table in Supabase dashboard
3. You should see a pending email entry

### Step 3: Process Emails Manually (For Testing)
Use this curl command or Postman:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/process-email-queue \
  -H "x-api-key: hostmate-email-processor-2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 4: Set Up Automatic Processing (Optional)
You can set up a cron job or use a service like:
- **Vercel Cron Jobs** (if deploying to Vercel)
- **GitHub Actions** with scheduled workflows
- **External cron service** hitting your API endpoint

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Email Status
```sql
-- See all emails in queue
SELECT * FROM email_queue ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Count by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM email_queue GROUP BY status;
```
