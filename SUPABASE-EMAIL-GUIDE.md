# Supabase Email Integration Guide

## Current Setup

Your reservation system now uses Supabase's database to queue emails, which provides a robust foundation for email delivery. Here's how it works:

### 1. Email Queue System
- **Table**: `email_queue` stores all outgoing emails
- **Function**: `queue_email()` adds emails to the queue
- **Status tracking**: pending â†’ sent/failed

### 2. Current Implementation
- Reservation emails are queued in Supabase database
- Console logging for development visibility
- Ready for production email service integration

## Next Steps for Production Email

### Option A: Supabase Edge Function (Recommended)
1. Deploy the provided Edge Function to Supabase
2. Set up a cron job to process the email queue
3. Integrate with your preferred email service (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)

### Option B: External Email Service
You can integrate any email service directly in the Next.js API route:

```typescript
// Example with Resend
import { Resend } from 'resend';
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com',
  to: reservation.displayEmail,
  subject: emailContent.subject,
  html: emailContent.body
});
```

### Option C: Use Supabase Auth Emails
For simple notifications, you can use Supabase's built-in auth email system with custom templates.

## Database Schema

Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard to set up the email queue:

```sql
-- See supabase-email-queue.sql for the complete setup
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reliable**: Emails are persisted in database
2. **Scalable**: Can handle high email volumes
3. **Monitored**: Track delivery status and errors
4. **Flexible**: Easy to switch email providers
5. **Retry Logic**: Can implement retry for failed emails

## Current Status

âœ… Authentication emails (Supabase built-in)
âœ… Email queue system set up
âœ… Reservation emails queued and logged
ðŸ”„ Production email delivery (next step)

Your system is production-ready for the core functionality. The email queue ensures no emails are lost and provides a clean upgrade path for production email delivery.
