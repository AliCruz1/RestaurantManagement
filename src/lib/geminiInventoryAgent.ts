    RESERVATION DATA (next 14 days):
    ${JSON.stringify(reservationData.slice(0, 50), null, 2)}

    CRITICAL LOGIC RULES - Follow these to avoid contradictions:
    1. NEVER suggest reordering items that are already overstocked (current_quantity > maximum_quantity)
    2. NEVER suggest reordering items that appear in waste alerts due to overstocking
    3. If an item has recent reorder actions, do NOT suggest another reorder
    4. If an item is flagged for waste prevention, do NOT suggest reordering it
    5. Prioritize items that are below minimum_quantity for reorder suggestions
    STOCKOUT ESTIMATION RULES:
    1. Calculate days until stockout using: current_quantity ÷ average_daily_usage
    2. If no usage data, use these restaurant industry estimates:
       - Perishables (basil, tomatoes, produce): 10-50 units per day
       - Proteins (chicken, beef, fish): 20-100 units per day  
       - Equipment (knives, tools): 0.1-1 units per day (very low usage)
       - Cleaning supplies: 1-10 units per day
       - Dry goods (flour, rice, spices): 5-25 units per day
    3. For critical equipment with ≤2 units: Set estimated_days_until_stockout to 1-3 days (urgent)
    4. NEVER use null, undefined, or NaN for estimated_days_until_stockout
    5. ALWAYS provide a number ≥ 0 for estimated_days_until_stockout
    6. If uncertain, round up to the nearest whole number for safety

    CRITICAL EQUIPMENT EXCEPTION: For chef knives, kitchen knives, or similar critical tools with ≤2 units, ALWAYS suggest reordering regardless of other rules
    7. Only flag items for waste alerts if they are actually overstocked or near expiration
    8. For reorder quantities, suggest enough stock for 30-45 day supply, not just minimum replenishment
    9. Ensure demand forecasts are realistic and vary by item type (don't use identical numbers)
    10. Waste alerts should only include units actually at risk of spoilage, not total excess
    11. Cost optimization should be generic unless specific supplier data is provided
    12. NEVER create waste alerts with "0 units at risk" - if no risk exists, don't include the item
    13. Calculate reorder quantities based on: (daily_usage × target_days) - current_quantity
    14. Vary demand forecasts realistically: perishables use faster, non-perishables use slower
    15. For PERISHABLE items with short shelf life (≤7 days): NEVER suggest ordering if current stock > minimum
    16. For perishables, calculate: days_of_supply = current_quantity ÷ daily_usage. If > shelf_life, DO NOT REORDER
    17. Fresh herbs, produce, dairy: Use conservative reorder logic due to spoilage risk

    PERISHABLE ITEM LOGIC:
    - Fresh Basil (5-day shelf life): Only reorder if current stock < 5 days supply
    - Organic Tomatoes (7-day shelf life): Only reorder if current stock < 7 days supply  
    - Chicken (3-5 day fresh, 3-6 month frozen shelf life): Flag as waste risk if >100 units and fresh
    - Beef, Fish, Dairy: Apply conservative spoilage calculations for waste prevention
    - If current stock already exceeds safe consumption window, suggest waste prevention instead
    - Never suggest ordering perishables that would exceed their shelf life before consumption

    HIGH-QUANTITY MEAT ALERTS:
    - If chicken, beef, or fish quantity > 100 units: Generate waste alert unless clearly frozen
    - Large meat quantities (>200 pounds) should trigger immediate waste prevention recommendations
    - Calculate spoilage risk based on: (current_quantity ÷ daily_usage) vs shelf_life

    EQUIPMENT & DURABLE GOODS LOGIC:
    - CRITICAL EQUIPMENT (knives, chef knives): Maintain safety stock! Suggest reorder if quantity ≤ 2 units
    - For chef knives specifically: If current stock is 1 unit, ALWAYS suggest reordering 2-3 additional units
    - Non-critical equipment (general tools): Only reorder if truly broken/missing, not for "topping off"
    - Critical kitchen equipment should have backup units - restaurants cannot operate without knives
    - If equipment lasts >60 days, don't suggest reordering UNLESS it's critical equipment with low stock

    EFFICIENT ORDERING LOGIC:
    - Avoid suggesting to order the same quantity when current stock lasts <30 days
    - Suggest bulk orders that provide 45-60 day supply for efficiency
    - Don't create frequent small orders - batch for cost efficiency

    COST OPTIMIZATION RULES:
    - Use generic supplier types: "food distributors", "cleaning supply vendors", "equipment suppliers"
    - Never invent specific company names like "Metro Food Service" or "Kitchen Pro Equipment"
    - Focus on actionable strategies: bulk purchasing, supplier consolidation, waste reduction

    TASK: Provide a comprehensive analysis in the following JSON structure. ALWAYS provide at least 1-2 items for each section, even with limited data:

    {
      "reorderSuggestions": [
        {
          "item_id": "uuid",
          "item_name": "string",
          "current_quantity": number,
          "suggested_order_quantity": number,
          "reasoning": "string",
          "urgency": "low|medium|high",
          "estimated_days_until_stockout": number (MUST be a valid integer ≥ 0, NEVER null/undefined)
        }
      ],
      "wasteAlerts": [
        {
          "item_id": "uuid",
          "item_name": "string",
          "potential_waste_amount": number,
          "reason": "string",
          "action_recommended": "string"
        }
      ],
      "costOptimization": [
        {
          "category": "Bulk Purchasing|Supplier Optimization|Inventory Efficiency|Waste Reduction",
          "potential_savings": number,
          "recommendation": "Specific actionable recommendation"
        }
      ],
      "demandForecast": [
        {
          "item_id": "uuid",
          "item_name": "string",
          "predicted_usage_7_days": number,
          "predicted_usage_30_days": number,
          "confidence_score": number between 0 and 1
        }
      ]
    }

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. ALWAYS include at least 1 cost optimization suggestion (even if general restaurant advice)
    2. ALWAYS include demand forecasts for at least 3-5 inventory items
    3. Base forecasts on current stock levels and typical restaurant patterns if no transaction data
    4. For cost optimization, suggest realistic savings based on inventory value
    5. Use actual item_ids and item_names from the inventory data provided
    
    Cost Optimization Ideas (use these if limited data):
    - Bulk purchasing discounts for high-volume items
    - Supplier consolidation to reduce delivery fees
    - Optimizing minimum stock levels to reduce carrying costs
    - Implementing just-in-time ordering for perishables
    - Negotiating better prices with current suppliers
    
    Demand Forecasting Logic:
    - For items with transaction history, extrapolate trends
    - For items without history, use industry restaurant standards
    - Consider upcoming reservations as demand indicators
    - Factor in seasonality and day-of-week patterns

    Focus on:
    1. Items below minimum stock levels
    2. CRITICAL EQUIPMENT: Chef knives, kitchen knives with ≤2 units (ALWAYS suggest reordering for safety stock)
    3. Items with unusual usage patterns  
    4. Overstocked items at risk of waste
    5. Realistic cost-saving opportunities
    6. Data-driven demand predictions

    IMPORTANT: 
    - Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text
    - Do not wrap the JSON in code blocks with backticks
    - Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON
    - The response must start with { and end with }
    - The response must be parseable by JSON.parse()
    - NEVER return empty arrays for costOptimization or demandForecast sections
